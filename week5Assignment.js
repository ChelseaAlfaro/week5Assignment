//Create a menu app as seen in this weekâ€™s video. What you create is up to you as long as it meets the following requirements:
//Use at least one array.
//Use at least two classes.
//Your menu should have the options to create, view, and delete elements.

// I created a menu that lets you 0) exit, 1) add movie, 2) view movies or 3) delete movies.
// I created a class called Movie in which you could create a movie and give it a title.
// I created a Menu class in which I created the methods that will allow the menu options to function.



// This is my movie class where I can create a new Movie and give it a title

class Movie {
    constructor(argument1,argument2){
        this.title = argument1;
        //this.runtime = argument2
        //this.likes = 0
        //^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        // Practice code from mentor session
    }



  //increaseLikes() {
    //this.likes += 1
// ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
// practice code from mentor session
  }
  



// movie1.increaseLikes()
// ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
// Practice code from mentor session



// This is my Menu class where I created a Menu that will hold all of the methods that allow you to view, push or delete
// from my array.
