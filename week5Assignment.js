//Create a menu app as seen in this weekâ€™s video. What you create is up to you as long as it meets the following requirements:
//Use at least one array.
//Use at least two classes.
//Your menu should have the options to create, view, and delete elements.

// I will have two classes, Actor and Movie. The Actor class will take actors and characters they have played. It will have a method called addActor
